# Crossfit Hong Kong
CrossFit is a branded fitness regimen created by Greg Classman. It has become a lifestyle characterized by safe, effective exercise and sound nutrition. However, though there are already 9 CrossFit gym in Hong Kong, no gym successfulln realize the combination of diet and exercise.
In this case, I came up with the proposal that a Healthy Square restaurant provide healthy and tasty food installed in CrossFit gyms in Hong Kong.

# Introduction
CrossFit 852 is differentiated from other traditional gym with its provision of well organized, highly intense and various programs. It provides partner or team based fitness routines which are enable its members to build inevitable bonding by sharing hardship. There has been new trend arising amongst millennial, which means that they go to CrossFit to exercise but they do stay for a community. This new trend portrays a distinctive function of CrossFit valued as a community for socializing. To chase this new trend we suggest to add a new service providing nutrition counseling and meal preparation. The major improvement of body composition from CrossFit is weight loss and muscle gain. According to Huffpost(2017), an expert emphasizes the importance of diet which takes 75% of the achievement while exercise takes 25%. This new service aims to satisfy the 75% of the needs and to help CrossFit gym users to achieve there own goal efficiently. This service will be introduced to CrossFit 852 located in Central Hong Kong first, where the market size will be 55,372 people.

Healthy Square mission is to help customers live a healthy lifestyle. The need for adding the service is to let gym member enjoy a well-fit diet. Healthy Square is targeting busy millennial group - working class and students - who rarely cook at home, eager to have a healthy diet and desire to achieve targeted weight efficiently. The unique selling point of Healthy Square meal box is that nutritionist investigates and designs the meal plan based on personal needs and desires. The nutritionist will communicate with personal trainer who knows the individual’s body condition the most. The other unique point is that people can also choose ingredients they want through mobile application which helps users to identify the amount of calories and macronutrients and micronutrients depending on their choice of ingredients. Gym users may be recommended to subscribe the member of Healthy Square to enjoy credits with relatively lower price. Customer can preorder food for breakfast, lunch, dinner. For the walk-in customers who do not have our app, they can order from self-ordering machine in the gym. The reason why Healthy Square only work with CrossFit Gym is due to CrossFit’s member are less price sensitive, they value more on experience and quality over price.

# Service Blueprint
In this service blueprint, two groups of customers are involved in this process. For gym members, they will receive nutritionist’s suggestions through mobile application before they arrive at the gym. From the next step, the process will be divided into two sides for those two groups of customers. For the users with CrossFit mobile application, they will be able to select ingredients or to order the food suggested by the nutritionist and make online payments via the application payment system. They can choose the time for pick up then a QR receipt will be generated on the app. This order will be sent to the kitchen and two chefs will prepare for food. When the customers arrive at the gym, they can simply receive the meal get prepared by presenting the QR receipt, and receive their own meal packages.

For the walk-in users, they can make an order and pay with the self-ordering machines which are located in the gym. The following process is same as the group ordering through the app. They will pick up their own meals with the QR receipt generated by the machines. If they have any difficulties with ordering through the machine, one staff will be on standby to help them solving the problem. Also the staff will help to interact with customers by serving prepared food box. All customers can take-out or stay in the restaurant to eat. After customers leave the dine-in area, the staff will be in charge of cleaning the area.

# Order Machine 
The customers can design the dish on the order machine with the same system. Also, the machine can scan the QR code and process your order done on cell phone app. In this way we can save the expensive human cost in Hong Kong and fasten the ordering process.

Designing for online dishes design system came with a lot of challenges:
- How can we deliver our concept
- How can we fasten and simplify the ordering process

### Ideation
- Colour: bright colour with high saturation
- Picture required for each ingredient
- Food blog, share your own design

### Test
In order to test the attractiveness for each prototyping, we use eye tracking technology to see the Area of Interests.

# Final Thoughts
This project was a combination of human computer interaction design and campagin marketing design. I feel my solution can solve many potential problems for the new restaurants and advocate for CrossFit in the long run. In our design, how to deliever our feature and fasten the process are the key problems to be considered. Through this project I can see the very interesting difference the system desihn can make to promote a project.
