# Introduction
The near decade requires science and technology in multiple fields. With the booming development of technology and the elevating public demand for better living condition, the smart home industry has attained a significant profit and a decent growth rate.
In this project, we wish we can design a smart home system to serve the olderly who live alone. All the devices were made with Arduino and could realise the serving goal.

# Soil Mositure Detector
It is healthy for the elderly to have one or two plants at home. But they may suffer from watering on time because of their declining memories. This device can detect the resistor of the soil and remind them to water the plants.

To build up this device, our team applies a moisture sensor and connects it with the Arduino UNO board. Through the output signal of the sensor, the processor can decide whether to alarm the user.

# Smart Power Strip
Remote control of the power strip can enhance the convenience and security of the elderly. The Smart Power Strip has two control modules. With Wi-Fi control module, the elderly can operate the electrical devices through wireless information transmission anywhere. The initial embedded module enables to collect the data of the environment in real time to decrease the risk of catching fire.

# Smart Clothes Rack and Curtain
The elderly tend to come across inconvenient situations when the clothes are hung up outside but inaccessible at rainy days, or the clothes are indoor with a shiny sunlight. The demand of a weather controlled clothes rack which has the automatic collecting function both to prevent the clothes from being drenched and to better exploit the sunlight.

The core components of the smart clothes rack include a light sensitive sensor and a motor. When the sensor detects the sunlight above a certain level, the clothes rack will be stretched to exploit the sunlight, while the rack will be pulled back when the sunlight below a certain rate. Manually push the button will also be available for pulling back the rack.

Similar devices is used in smart curtain. The elderly People can be more energetic, mind-active and also healthy when woken up by natural light.

# Smart Rubbish Bin
The idea of smart rubbish bin comes from some unsatisfied experience of using rubbish bin. When people are not willing to deal with the dirty handle of the bin, the demand of the trash bin with an automatically opening function is quite urgent for convenience.

For the function of the rubbish bin, our team use an ultrasound sensor to detect the user. The ultrasound sensor will generate a signal to the Arduino UNO when the sensor detects that the distance of the user is within 15cm and controls the motor to open the rubbish bin. The same process will repeat when the sensor fails to detect the user. Further, considering the weight of the lid, our team applies a high gear ratio gearbox to generate a large torque to complete the task.
