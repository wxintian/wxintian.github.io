### Tools
Visual c++ 6.0 mfc application

### User Research
First, we need to specify the audience of the website and get to understand their goals. Here we may take audience during Spring Festival.
We did online snow ball survey in order to understand the bigges needs of website users. 200 participants aged from 21 to 46 have done the survey.

**Following analysis can be drew from the survey result.**

 * **Taget User**
Taget railway customers during Spring Festival are mainly university students and adults working outside hometown in China. Most of them prefer to have quick access to train schedules and look for low prices within flexible dates.

 * **Main User Care**
Price, duration, number of changing

 * **Assumption of User goals**
They want to find the best train with firstly the cheapest price, secondly the shortest duration. And there is a must to bring them home before spring festival eve.

### Ideation

**Current Workflow**

The current workflow includes two parts: search page and loading page.

As we can see, the current system put the most important factor "price" into the last order. This means users have to research again to find a cheaper price if the finally results do not meet the requirements. Also, the duration time is not clearly shown.

                                                        `12306.com old page`  


**Pain Point**
 * No search history
 * No ranking procedure
 * Poor suggestions on lines combination

**A New Flow**

Given the mentioned points, I proposed a new filter
